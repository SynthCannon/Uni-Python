# Gnuplot script file for plotting data in a data file

# This file is called drawboxgraph

# ***Usage*** call 'drawboxgraph' '<datafile name>' '<title for the graph>' '<x-axis label>' '<y-axis label>' ***

# Plots, using boxes, a set of x and y values (in the first two columns) 
# Derived from drawgraph

# Modified 23/11/08 to only use the first two columns - if it is present, the third 
# column is used for the width, which can cause trouble!
#
# This first line clears all previous settings - such as you may have from previous graphs.

# There seems to be a glitch with setting the terminal properties from a batch file -
# it forgets them! So they need to be repeated here. This is not a problem when
# using gnuplot interactively.

# The two plots follow each other so quickly you will
