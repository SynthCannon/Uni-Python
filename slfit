# Gnuplot script file to fit a straight line to data already plotted with drawgraph and 
# draw the fitted line onto the graph. No use is made of any further columns to weight the fit.

# The gradient and intercept, together with their standard errors, are
# displayed on the terminal.

# Modified 2/10/03 to make the fitted line drawn as solid, rather than dashed
# Comments altered 16/7/04 to make clear that it is an unweighted fit.

# First specify the type of function to be fitted, in this case a straight line.
f(x) = m*x + c

# Then call the fitting routine, telling it which parameters to vary to obtain the fit.
fit f(x) '$0' via m, c

# Finally replot the data superimposing this line on the graph
