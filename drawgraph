# Gnuplot script file for plotting data in a data file 
# 
# This file is called drawgraph
#
# ***Usage*** call 'drawgraph' '<datafile name>' '<title for the graph>' '<x-axis label>' '<y-axis label>' ***
# 
# Plots a set of x and y values (in the first two columns) with error bars corresponding
# to the third and fourth columns.

# S J Flockton, 18/9/03, modified 16/7/04 to move date to top of plot and unset mouse to
# avoid confusion for new users. Note that the mouse can be switched on with the hot key
# 'm' in the graph window to enable zooming etc.
#
# This first line clears all previous settings - such as you may have from previous graphs.
reset

# This ensures your graphs will print clearly on a monochrome printer.
set terminal windows monochrome 

# This plots the data, with the error bars if provided. If columns 3 and 4 are empty,
# then no error bars are drawn.
plot '$0' title '' with xyerrorbars

# These next four lines set the graph title, the axis labels and the timestamp.
set title '$1'
set xlabel '$2'
set ylabel '$3'
set timestamp "%a %b %d %Y %H:%M" top

# There seems to be a glitch with setting the terminal properties from a batch file -
# it forgets them! So they need to be repeated here. This is not a problem when
# using gnuplot interactively.
set terminal windows monochrome

unset mouse

# and this replots the same data, now with the axis labels and timestamp. 
# The two plots follow each other so quickly you will 
# not see them separately.
