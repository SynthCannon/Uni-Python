# ***Usage*** call 'expfit' '<datafile name>' ***
#
# Gnuplot script file to fit a Boltzmann equation to data already plotted with drawgraph and 
# draw the fitted line onto the graph. If the y data points have error estimates
# in column 4 of the datafile, the fit uses these to weight the points.
#
# The values of the fitted parameters, together with their standard errors, are
# displayed on the terminal.

# Modified 2/10/03 to make the fitted line drawn as solid, rather than dashed
# Modified3/10/03 from slfit.

# First specify the type of function to be fitted
f(x) = I0*exp(beta*x)

# Then call the fitting routine, telling it which parameters to vary to obtain the fit.
fit f(x) '$0' via I0, beta

# Finally replot the data superimposing this line on the graph
plot f(x) title 'Exponential fit', '$0' notitle with xyerrorbars
